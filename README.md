# <divs>

Monorepo for [Divs by Idreezus](https://divs.idreezus.com) — a component library for Webflow and other no-code platforms.

This repository contains the helper libraries that power the components.

## Packages

### Marquee

GSAP-powered marquee component for seamless infinite scrolling. Features truly continuous animations with no visible jumps, automatic responsive behavior with breakpoint-aware direction changes, performance optimization via IntersectionObserver, and built-in accessibility. Configure with data attributes for logo carousels, testimonial streams, news tickers, and scrolling galleries.

### Carousel

Lightweight, CSS-first carousel library built on native scroll snap for smooth GPU-accelerated scrolling. Zero dependencies with simple data-attribute configuration, auto-generated pagination dots, optional keyboard navigation, and support for variable-width items. Features responsive design with automatic recalculation, chainable programmatic API, event system, and state classes for custom styling. Perfect for product showcases, image galleries, testimonials, and card carousels.

### Theme Toggle

A lightweight, zero-dependency theme engine that combines a flicker‑free head script with a small, CSS‑driven API for building light, dark, and custom themes. It keeps state and UI separate: the library manages system sync, localStorage, and ARIA state, while you define the look and feel with your own tokens and transitions. Data attributes power buttons and toggles automatically (with active states), and a refreshable JS API makes it straightforward to integrate in SPAs and dynamic sites.

### Tabs

An accessible, keyboard-navigable tabs component with autoplay support. Uses value-based linking between triggers and panels (not array indices), enabling flexible layouts where triggers and panels can live anywhere in the DOM. Features full ARIA compliance, URL deep linking, CSS custom properties for animations, IntersectionObserver-powered autoplay with pause-on-hover/focus, support for multiple triggers per panel, and nested tabs without conflicts.
