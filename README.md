Monorepo for [Divs by Idreezus](https://divs.idreezus.com) — a component library for Webflow and other no-code platforms.

This repository contains the helper libraries that power the components.

## Packages

### Marquee

GSAP-powered marquee component for seamless infinite scrolling. Features truly continuous animations with no visible jumps, automatic responsive behavior with breakpoint-aware direction changes, performance optimization via IntersectionObserver, and built-in accessibility. Configure with data attributes for logo carousels, testimonial streams, news tickers, and scrolling galleries.

### Carousel

SwiperJS helper for Webflow that eliminates the need to touch Javascript or deal with Swiper's required CSS classes (`.swiper`, `.swiper-wrapper`, `.swiper-slide`). Configure sliders entirely with data attributes, supports all SwiperJS modules and effects, handles multiple independent sliders per page, and includes Webflow-friendly breakpoint shorthands. Ideal for product galleries, testimonials, and any carousel implementation.
